/*
Write a method, which replaces every nth char oldValue with char newValue.

Method:

replaceNth(std::string text, int n, char oldValue, char newValue)

Example:

n:         2
oldValue: 'a'
newValue: 'o'
"Vader said: No, I am your father!" -> "Vader soid: No, I am your fother!"
  1     2          3        4       -> 2nd and 4th occurence are replaced

Your method has to be case sensitive!

As you can see in the example: The first changed is the 2nd 'a'. So the start is always at the nth suitable char and not at the first!

If n is 0 or negative or if it is larger than the count of the oldValue, return the original text without a change.

The text and the chars will never be null.
