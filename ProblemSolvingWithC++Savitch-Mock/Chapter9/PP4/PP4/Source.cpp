/*
Programming Project 4, Savitch, Chapter 9, pg 565
A palindrome word reads the same both backward and forward. Write a function which takes a string as an input parameter.
The program should then test whether the string is a palindrome.
One pointer should point to the beginning of the word and another which points to the end of the word.
If the two words in these pointers is the same, then print palindrome; otherwise print non-palindrome.
