Dear Nathan Stasin 

Re: 2017 Inc. Automotive Industry Survey 

In the past year, the U.S. automotive market once again had its best year ever - topping 17.5 million vehicles. 
As of the first half of 2017, total sales are down slightly, but with a strong second half push, could exceed last year's record. 

As a valued member of the Inc. community, we want to know your preferences when it comes to purchasing vehicles for both your personal life and for your company, as well as your attitudes and opinions about the auto industry.

Your privacy is very important to us, so please be assured that your responses will be treated in complete confidence and will only be used in combination with those of other respondents. 

The survey should take about 15 minutes to complete. Once completed, you will also have the opportunity to enter a draw for one of three $100 gift cards.
